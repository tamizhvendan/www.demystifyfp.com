Writing software using Clojure is a joyful experience. I was fortunate to have the opportunity of shipping two products developed using Clojure in the past ten months. I enjoyed every moment of it. 

It was a scintillating journey from being a sceptic to a proponent, and I learned a lot in this process. 

Through this "Demystifying Clojure" blog post series, I am going to share my learning, understanding and experiences.
